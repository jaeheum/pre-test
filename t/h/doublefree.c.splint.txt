t/h/doublefree.c: (in function troublefree_if)
t/h/doublefree.c:17:3: Variable x is released in true branch, but live in
                          continuation.
  The state of a variable is different depending on which branch is taken. This
  means no annotation can sensibly be applied to the storage. (Use -branchstate
  to inhibit warning)
   t/h/doublefree.c:17:3: in true branch:
   t/h/doublefree.c:16:10: Storage x released
   t/h/doublefree.c:17:3: in continuation:

t/h/doublefree.c: (in function doublefree)
t/h/doublefree.c:30:8: Dead storage x passed as out parameter to free: x
  Memory is used after it has been released (either by passing as an only param
  or assigning to an only global). (Use -usereleased to inhibit warning)
